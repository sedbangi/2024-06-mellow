/**
 * @title ManagedValidator
 * @notice A role-based validator that provides control over access permissions.
 *         Allows role-based management of contract permissions and supports custom validation logic.
 *
 *         The primary validator contract of the system, used to check the access permissions of users to call contracts with specified selectors.
 *         The main function of the contract is hasPermissions(from, to, selector), which checks whether the specified caller "from" has the right to make the call to.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector, someData)).
 *
 *         Bitwise masks are used to store roles, thus the maximum number of roles in the system is limited to 256 (0-255).
 *         The system consists of 4 types of roles:
 *             1. publicRoles - bitmask of public roles available to all users
 *             2. userRoles - bitmask of roles for the calling user
 *             3. allowAllSignaturesRoles - bitmask of roles for the called contract
 *             4. allowSignatureRoles - bitmask of roles for the called contract and specific selector
 *
 *         Additionally, the system has a dedicated role - 255 - ADMIN_ROLE, which grants full access to all contract functions without additional checks.
 *
 *         Therefore, the hasPermissions algorithm looks like this:
 *             1. Determine the set of roles possessed by the specified user (userRoles[from] | publicRoles)
 *             2. If the user has the ADMIN_ROLE role, access is granted ((userRoles[from] | publicRoles) & ADMIN_ROLE_MASK != 0)
 *             3. If the called contract has at least one role in its corresponding set that matches a role in the user's role set, access is granted (allowAllSignaturesRoles[to] & (publicRoles | userRoles[from]) != 0)
 *             4. If the called contract with specified function selector have at least one role in their corresponding role sets that matches a role in the user's role set, access is granted (allowSignatureRoles[to][selector] & (publicRoles | userRoles[from]) != 0)
 *             5. Otherwise, access is denied and the function returns false
 *
 *         For greater flexibility, it is possible to set a custom validator for the called contract, which will be used after the standard check of permissions.
 *         Thus, the validate function checks the presence of permissions as follows:
 *             1. If the data does not contain at least 4 bytes (required for the selector), the function reverts with an InvalidData error.
 *             2. If the hasPermissions function returns false, the function reverts with a Forbidden error.
 *             3. If a custom validator is set for the contract, the validate function of the custom validator is called.
